1. regression
2. classification
3. confusion matrix
    |          | positive       | negative       |
    |----------|----------------|----------------|
    | positive | true positive  | false negative |
    | negative | false positive | true negative  |
  - example: spam email
    |          | filtered             | not filtered             | 
    |----------|----------------------|--------------------------|
    | spam     | spam filtered TP     | spam not filtered FN     |
    | not spam | not spam filtered FP | not spam not filtered TN |
  - example: medical diagnosis
    |         | treated            | not treated            | 
    |---------|--------------------|------------------------|
    | ill     | ill treated TP     | ill not treated FN     | 
    | not ill | not ill treated FP | not ill not treated TN |
  - multiclasses
    |         | healthy         | cold             | flu         |
    |---------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
    | healthy | healthy healthy | healthy negative | healthy flu |
    | cold    | cold healthy    | cold cold        | cold flu    | 
    | flu     | flu healthy     | flu cold         | flu flu     |

5. week3 Assignment: 
    - classification, Logistic regression, supervised
    - [Analyzing product sentiment](https://github.com/Makiato1999/note-ML/tree/main/Foundations/Week3)
6. cluster flow

7. week4 Assignment: 
    - classification, K-nearest neighbors(KNN), supervised
    - [Retrieving Wikipedia articles](https://github.com/Makiato1999/note-ML/tree/main/Foundations/Week4)
8. Collaborative filtering
    - SVD(Singular Value Decomposition), [details(简中)](https://www.cnblogs.com/pinard/p/6251584.html)
    - PCA(Principal component analysis), (I remember this is my COMP4360 last chapter, pretty interesting)
9. Recommender systems ML block diagram

1. recall & precision
    - recall: (#liked & shown) / #liked
    - precision: (#liked & shown) / #shown

2. no-linear features with neural network
    - ```x1*w1 + x2*w2```w is weight, we can change weight to control classifier

    - Two examples
        1. (x1 AND x2) OR (NOT x1 AND NOT x2)
            - z1 OR z2
                - z1 = x1 AND x2
                - z2 = NOT x1 AND NOT x2
